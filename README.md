# DIG1712-Level-Building-Design

mainly look at Assets\Scripts\ScelOne as it tried to what Assets\Scripts\BulletCollision did without having to add the script on both the "bullet" and enemy
it also makes it where each enemy can be identical as to not have to many scripts and allows for respawnable enemies
still work in progess but i might as well upload something
